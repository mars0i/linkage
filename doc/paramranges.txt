Allowed parameter ranges

Some parameters will make it run for a long time.  This may cause the
Clojurescript version to fail.  These values are based on testing in
Clojure.  It also could be that there are combinations of parameters
that will fail even though they would be OK individually.

r [0,1]

s (0,1]
Although theoretically s can be 0, in that case the simulation will
run forever or until the system gives up, unless it stops immediately,
because there will be no change in the B locus frequencies that is
tested for stopping.

h [0,1]

x1 [0,1]
x2 [0,1]
x3 [0,1]

x1+x2+x3 [0,1]

x1+x2 (0,1]
You have to have positive initial frequency in x1 or x3, or it will run
forever or until the system gives up, because there will be no variation 
at the linked neutral locus and the frequencies there will always
remain below the threshold for continuing.
