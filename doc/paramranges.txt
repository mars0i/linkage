Allowed parameter ranges

The values below are based on testing in Clojure.  It also could be that
there are combinations of parameters that will fail even though they
would be OK individually.  I haven't investigated that.  i.e. these are
parameters that should work in at least some combinations.

Some parameters will make it run for a long time, and might cause the
Clojurescript version to fail even if the parameters are legal.

r [0,1]

s (0,1]
Although theoretically s can be 0, in that case the simulation will
run forever or until the system gives up, unless it stops immediately,
because there will be no change in the B locus frequencies that is
tested for stopping.

h [0,1]

x1 [0,1]
x2 [0,1]
x3 [0,1]

x1+x2+x3 [0,1]
Note that x4 = 1 - (x1 + x2 + x3)

x1+x2 (0,1]
You have to have positive initial frequency in x1 or x3, which are the
haplotype frequencies that include the focal neutral B allele, or the
simulation will run forever or until the system gives up, because there
will be no variation at the linked neutral locus and the frequencies
there will always remain below the threshold for continuing.
